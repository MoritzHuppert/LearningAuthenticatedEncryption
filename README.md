# Learning Authenticated Encryption

This repo extends the Google Brain paper [Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06918.pdf), which introduces a novel deep learning architecture to learn a symmetric encryption system, for authenticated encryption.
